A radiopharmaceutical composed of the dichloride salt of the alpha-emitting isotope radium Ra 223, with antineoplastic activity. Like calcium, radium targets bone tissue and preferentially accumulates in osteoblastic lesions, such as those seen in areas of bone metastases. Radium Ra 223 forms complexes with hydroxyapatite and becomes incorporated into the bone matrix. The radioisotope Ra 223 kills bone cancer cells through local emission of high energy alpha particles, causing DNA double-strand breaks and tumor regression in the skeleton. The short range effects of alpha emission allows for localized DNA damage with limited toxicity to nearby healthy bone tissue.|A radiopharmaceutical composed of the dichloride salt of a protein molecule, with anti-cancer activity.

A cell-based cancer vaccine composed of autologous dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with lysates from an allogeneic glioblastoma (GBM) stem-like cell line, with potential immunostimulatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration allogeneic glioblastoma stem-like cell line lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine exposes the immune system to GBM stem cell antigens, which may result in cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and antibody responses against GBM cells. This leads to GBM cell lysis. GBM stem-like cells contain a specific range of antigens that are essential for the neoplastic growth and survival of GBM cells.

A programmed cell death characterized morphologically by the presence of smaller than normal mitochondria with condensed mitochondrial membrane densities, reduction or vanishing of mitochondria crista, and outer mitochondrial membrane rupture. Activation of mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels and mitogen-activated protein kinases, upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inhibition of cystine/glutamate antiporter are involved in the induction of ferroptosis. This process is characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products and lethal reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from iron metabolism. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), heat shock protein beta-1, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 function as negative regulators of ferroptosis by limiting ROS production and reducing cellular iron uptake, respectively. In contrast, NADPH oxidase and p53 act as positive regulators of ferroptosis by promotion of ROS production and inhibition of expression of SLC7A11 (a specific light-chain subunit of the cystine/glutamate antiporter), respectively. Misregulated ferroptosis has been implicated in multiple physiological and pathological processes.

A colloidal mixture of nanoparticles consisting of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting the native eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), plasmids expressing a pro-apoptotic mutant of elF5A under the control of a B-cell specific promoter (B29), and a synthetic cationic polymer polyethylenimine (PEI) as a delivery vehicle, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, the siRNA component of SNS01-T suppresses elF5A expression, thereby interfering with translation of eIF5A and reducing levels of hypusinated elF5A in cancer cells. In turn, this inhibits activation of the transcription factor NF-kB and induces apoptosis. In addition, the B-cell specific plasmid component expresses an arginine substituted form of eIF5A, eIF5AK50R, which can not be hypusinated, thus leads to a selective induction of apoptosis in B-cells. The native unhypusinated form of eIF5A is pro-apoptotic and can be modified at the lysine residue, by deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) and subsequently deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DHH), to the anti-apoptotic hypusinated form which is associated with tumor cell growth and survival. The delivery vehicle protects the siRNA and plasmid from degradation.

A plasmid encoding the protein antiangiogenic metargidin plasmid (AMEP), the disintegrin domain of ADAM-15 (metargidin), with potential antiangiogenic and antimetastatic activities. Upon intratumoral electrotransfer of plasmid encoding AMEP, AMEP binds to cellular integrin receptors alpha-v-beta-3 (avb3) and alpha-5-beta-1 (a5b1), which are upregulated on activated endothelial cells and a variety of tumor cells. Binding to the integrin receptors may inhibit angiogenesis and may inhibit tumor cell proliferation.

A very rare hereditary neurological dysmorphic syndrome with characteristics of moyamoya disease, short stature of postnatal onset and stereotypical facial dysmorphism. The syndrome is extremely rare and has been reported in three unrelated families to date, with 10 affected individuals in several generations. These families are not from Japan or Asia, whereas in general the incidence of moyamoya disease is highest in Japan and other Asian countries, in comparison with other parts of the world. Affected patients are all male (X-linked inheritance) and have moyamoya angiopathy (progressive stenosis of the terminal portion of the intracranial internal carotid arteries), short stature, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and other variable manifestations.. The genetic cause appears to involve Xq28 deletions removing MTCP1/CMC4 and BRCC3 (Xq28) .The specific pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this disorder remain obscure, but appear to involve alteration in DNA repair.|A rare genetic disorder with characteristics of moyamoya disease, short stature of postnatal onset and stereotypical facial features.

The anterior abdominal wall constitutes a hexagonal area defined superiorly by the costal margins and xiphoid process; and inferiorly by the iliac crests, inguinal ligament, pubis and pubic symphysis. The wall extends posteriorly and incorporates the lateral aspect of the wall until the junction with the posterior abdominal wall approximately at the mid-axillary line. The wall is covered externally by skin and subcutaneous tissue: beneath this lies the superficial fascia (between the dermis and the muscles), which is conventionally divided into a superficial fatty layer (Camper's fascia) and a deep membranous layer (Scarpa's fascia); deep fascia; the rectus abdominis, pyramidalis, external oblique, internal oblique and transversus abdominis; and the extraperitoneal tissue and the parietal peritoneum.

An inhibitor of the bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, the BRD4 inhibitor PLX51107 binds to the acetylated lysine recognition motifs in the bromodomains of the BRD4 protein, thereby preventing the binding of BRD4 to acetylated lysines on histones. This disrupts chromatin remodeling and gene expression. Prevention of the expression of certain growth-promoting genes may lead to an induction of apoptosis and an inhibition of proliferation in BRD4-overexpressing tumor cells. BRD4, a member of the human bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family of proteins, is a transcriptional regulator that is overexpressed in certain tumor cells and plays an important role in cellular proliferation.|An inhibitor of the bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), with potential anti-cancer activity.

A lozenge containing an extract from the Lactobacillus brevis (L. brevis) with potential anti-inflammatory activity. As L. brevis CD2 contains high levels of arginine deiminase, which catalyzes the conversion of arginine to citrulline and ammonia, administration of this lozenge leads to hydrolysis of arginine in the oral cavity. The growth of bacteria, which depends on arginine, is halted, polyamine biosynthesis is reduced and the production of nitric oxide (NO) is reduced. The reduction in NO generation may further prevent inflammation in the oral cavity. Therefore, this agent may be able to reduce chemo- and radiotherapy-induced mucositis.

A nanodispersion containing the benzoquinone ubidecarenone (coenzyme Q10), with potential protective, antioxidant and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, ubidecarenone nanodispersion BPM31510 modulates tumor cell metabolism and causes an anti-Warburg effect by inducing a shift from lactate dependency towards mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and induces tumor cell apoptosis. This inhibits tumor cell proliferation. BPM 31510 also induces the activation and maturation of T lymphocytes, and changes the surface expression of certain immune checkpoint modulators. In addition, as an antioxidant, ubidecarenone protects against cell damage, by preventing both the peroxidation of lipid membranes and the oxidation of LDL-cholesterol. Ubidecarenone is an essential coenzyme for mitochondrial enzyme complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

A monoclonal antibody directed against the cell surface protein claudin 6 (CLDN6), with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, the anti-CLDN6 monoclonal antibody IMAB027 binds to CLDN-6 and may stimulate the immune system to exert both an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and a complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)-mediated immune response against CLDN-6-expressing tumor cells. This may inhibit tumor cell growth. CLDN-6, a tight-junction protein and embryonic antigen, is expressed on a variety of tumor cells but is not expressed on normal, healthy adult cells.

A peptide vaccine containing five immunogenic peptide epitopes of the human folate receptor alpha (FR alpha or FOLR1), including FR30, FR56, FR76, FR113, and FR238, with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, the multi-epitope FR alpha peptide vaccine may induce a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against FR alpha-overexpressing tumor cells. FR alpha is a high-affinity folate-binding protein and a member of the folate receptor family; this receptor is overexpressed in a majority of ovarian cancers and in about 50% of breast cancers.

A complex syndrome resulting from various genetic and epigenetic anomalies of the 11p15.5 chromosomal region, leading to dysregulated expression of imprinted genes. Specific genes involved include CDKN1C, H19, IGF2, and KCNQ1OT1. One of the key genetic anomalies is an imbalance between the paternally expressed IGF2 growth enhancer gene and the maternally expressed H19 growth suppressor gene, leading to fetal and postnatal overgrowth. The condition is typically characterized by macrosomia, macroglossia, umbilical hernia or more severe abdominal wall anomalies such as omphalocele, ear lobe indentations, and hypoglycemia associated with hyperinsulinemia due to pancreatic islet cell hyperplasia. Patients with this syndrome have an increased risk for development of embryonal tumors (particularly Wilms tumor and hepatoblastoma) and adrenal cortex carcinoma.|A complex syndrome resulting from various genetic and epigenetic anomalies of the 11p15.5 chromosome region, leading to dysregulated expression of imprinted genes.

The term 'phyto' originated from a Greek word meaning plant. Phytonutrients are certain organic components of plants, and these components are thought to promote human health. Fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts and teas are rich sources of phytonutrients. Unlike the traditional nutrients (protein, fat, vitamins, minerals), phytonutrients are not 'essential' for life, so some people prefer the term 'phytochemical'.

A monoamine compound with positive inotropic activity. Dopamine is a naturally occurring catecholamine formed by decarboxylation of dehydroxyphenylalanine and a precursor of norepinephrine and epinephrine. Dopamine binds to alpha-1 and beta-1 adrenergic receptors. Mediated through myocardial beta-1 adrenergic receptors, dopamine increase heart rate and force, thereby increasing cardiac output. Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor stimulation on vascular smooth muscle, leads to vasoconstriction and results in an increase in systemic vascular resistance. Stimulation of dopaminergic receptors in renal vasculature, leads to renal blood vessel dilation, and an increase in glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, sodium excretion, and urine output.|A monoamine compound with positive inotropic activity.

A bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) antibody composed of two single-chain variable fragments (scFv), one directed against the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) human B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA; TNFRSF17), fused to one that is directed against the CD3 antigen found on T lymphocytes, with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of anti-BCMA/CD3 BiTE antibody AMG 701, this bispecific antibody binds to both CD3 on cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and BCMA found on BCMA-expressing tumor cells. This activates and redirects CTLs to BCMA-expressing tumor cells, which results in the CTL-mediated cell death of BCMA-expressing tumor cells. BCMA, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily that is specifically overexpressed on malignant plasma cells, plays a key role in promoting plasma cell survival.|A bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) antibody composed of two single-chain variable fragments (scFv), one directed against the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) human protein complexes found on tumor cells, which results in the CTL-mediated cell death of|15.390000000000015|6.944285714285741|17.075000000000006|20.985714285714284|13.87226923076923|13.515500000000001|23.63266666666667|27.83085714285714|20.253999999999998|22.591|101.87285929039194|129.0119750255766|27.266666666666666|33.42857142857143

A replication incompetent adenoviral vector type 5 (Ad5) encoding the tumor suppressor gene dickkopf-3 (DKK3; reduced expression in immortalized cells; REIC; Dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 3), and containing the super gene expression (SGE) system, composed of the triple tandem enhancer sequences of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), simian virus 40 (SV40) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon intratumoral (IT) injection and transfection of Ad5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3 MTG-201, tumor cells express REIC/DKK3 protein. This may result in the activation of c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK) and ultimately lead to apoptosis via B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl2) suppression and caspase-3 activation. Increased expression of REIC/DKK3 in cancer cells may lead to an induction of tumor cell apoptosis and a reduction in tumor cell growth, while sparing normal, healthy cells expressing endogenous REIC/DKK3. In addition, the tumor cell killing promotes a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response, thereby further killing any remaining REIC-deficient, untransfected tumor cells. The SGE system, also called C-TSC (CMV promoter driving the triple tandem enhancer sequences of hTERT, SV40 and CMV), enhances gene expression compared to more conventional adenoviral vectors. REIC/DKK3 is expressed by healthy cells, but expression is reduced or absent in many cancer cells due to REIC/DKK3 gene defects. As REIC/DKK3 plays a key role in tumor cell apoptosis, the absence of the REIC protein in tumor cells prevents tumor cell apoptosis.|A viral vector type 5 (Ad5) encoding a tumor suppressor gene dickkopf-3 (DKK3; reduced expression in immortalized cells; REIC; Dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 3), and containing the super gene expression system, also called C-TSC|30.890225225225237|31.11571428571429|15.078648648648652|17.614285714285717|15.130125210084035|17.847645945945946|24.39243243243243|25.982857142857142|19.38957983193277|21.892972972972977|108.39173953766033|129.0119750255766|29.326126126126127|33.42857142857143

Autologous human T-lymphocytes transduced with a recombinant lentiviral vector encoding a chimeric T-cell receptor (chimeric antigen receptor or CAR) consisting of an anti-CD22 single chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from the monoclonal antibody (moAb) 971 (m971), and the co-stimulatory domain 4-1BB (CD137) coupled to the zeta chain of the TCR/CD3 complex (CD3-zeta), with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from a patient with CD22-positive cancer are transduced with this lentiviral vector that encodes the CAR gene specific for CD22. After expansion in culture and reintroduction into the patient, the anti-CD22-CAR m971-BBz lentiviral vector-transduced autologous T-lymphocytes express anti-CD22-CAR on their cell surfaces and bind to the CD22 antigen on tumor cell surfaces. Subsequently, CD22-expressing tumor cells are lysed. CD22, a B-lineage-restricted, transmembrane phosphoglycoprotein, is expressed on malignant B-cells. m971 binds to a membrane proximal epitope on CD22 and has a higher binding affinity compared to any other anti-CD22 moAb.

<h3>What is stuttering?</h3> <p>Stuttering is a <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/speechandcommunicationdisorders.html">speech disorder</a>. It involves interruptions in the flow of speech. These interruptions are called disfluencies. They may involve</p> <ul> <li>Repeating sounds, syllables, or words</li> <li>Stretching out a sound</li> <li>Suddenly stopping in the middle of a syllable or word</li> </ul> <p>Sometimes, along with the stuttering, there may be nodding, rapid blinking, or trembling lips. The stuttering may be worse when you are stressed, excited, or tired.</p> <p>Stuttering can be frustrating, because you know exactly what you want to say, but you have trouble saying it. It can make it difficult to communicate with people. This can cause problems with school, work, and relationships.</p> <h3>What causes stuttering?</h3> <p>There are two main types of stuttering, and they have different causes:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Developmental stuttering</strong> is the more common type. It starts in young children while they are still learning speech and language skills. Many children stutter when they first start talking. Most of them will outgrow it. But some continue to stutter, and the exact cause is unknown. There are differences in the brains of people who continue to stutter. Genetics may also play a role, since this type of stuttering can run in families.</li> <li><strong>Neurogenic stuttering</strong> can happen after someone has a <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/stroke.html">stroke</a>, <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/headinjuries.html">head trauma</a>, or other type of <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/traumaticbraininjury.html">brain injury</a>. Because of the injury, the brain has trouble coordinating the different parts of the brain involved in speech.</li> </ul> <h3>Who is at risk for stuttering?</h3> <p>Stuttering can affect anyone, but it is much more common in boys than girls. Younger children are most likely to stutter. About 75 percent of children who stutter will get better. For the rest, stuttering can continue their whole lives.</p> <h3>How is stuttering diagnosed?</h3> <p>Stuttering is usually diagnosed by a speech-language pathologist. This is a health professional who is trained to test and treat people with voice, speech, and language disorders. If you or your child stutters, your regular health care provider may give you a referral to a speech-language pathologist. Or in some cases, a child's teacher may make a referral.</p> <p>To make a diagnosis, the speech-language pathologist will</p> <ul> <li>Look at the case history, such as when the stuttering was first noticed, how often it happens, and in what situations it happens</li> <li>Listen to you or your child speak and analyze the stuttering</li> <li>Evaluate you or your child's speech and language abilities, including the ability to understand and use language</li> <li>Ask about the impact of stuttering on you or your child's life</li> <li>Ask whether stuttering runs in the family</li> <li>For a child, consider how likely it is that he or she will outgrow it</li> </ul> <h3>What are the treatments for stuttering?</h3> <p>There are different treatments that can help with stuttering. Some of these may help one person but not another. You need to work with the speech-language pathologist to figure out the best plan for you or your child.</p> <p>The plan should take into account how long the stuttering has been going on and whether there are any other speech or language problems. For a child, the plan should also take into account your child's age and whether he or she is likely to outgrow the stuttering.</p> <p>Younger children may not need therapy right away. Their parents and teachers can learn strategies to help the child practice speaking. That can help some children. As a parent, it's important to be calm and relaxed when your child is speaking. If your child feels pressured, it can make it harder for them to talk. The speech-language pathologist will probably want to evaluate your child regularly, to see whether treatment is needed.</p> <p>Speech therapy can help children and adults minimize stuttering. Some techniques include</p> <ul> <li>Speaking more slowly</li> <li>Controlling breathing</li> <li>Gradually working up from single-syllable responses to longer words and more complex sentences</li> </ul> <p>For adults, self-help groups can help you find resources and support as you face the challenges of stuttering.</p> <p>There are electronic devices to help with fluency, but more research is needed to see whether they really help over the long term. Some people have tried medicines that usually treat other health problems such as epilepsy, anxiety, or depression. But these medicines are not approved for stuttering, and they often have side effects.</p> <p class="">NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</p>|ASD can affect anyone, but it is much more common in boys than girls.

A fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the neonatal crystallizable fragment receptor (FcRn), with potential immunomodulating activity. Upon administration, nipocalimab targets and binds to FcRn at the immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding site, thereby preventing the interaction between FcRn and the serum protein IgG. By preventing FcRn/IgG binding, nipocalimab blocks the FcRn-mediated rescue of IgG, enables IgG degradation and prevents IgG-mediated inflammation. IgG plays a key role in many autoimmune diseases and is an important factor in inflammatory processes.|A fully human monoclonal antibody that targets a neonatal crystallizable fragment receptor, with potential immunomodulating activity.

A semi-synthetic, second-generation taxane derived from a compound found in the European yew tree, Taxus baccata. Docetaxel displays potent and broad antineoplastic properties; it binds to and stabilizes tubulin, thereby inhibiting microtubule disassembly which results in cell- cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and cell death. This agent also inhibits pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and displays immunomodulatory and pro-inflammatory properties by inducing various mediators of the inflammatory response.

A radioimmunoconjugate comprised of a recombinant scFv dimer diabody of a monoclonal antibody against human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) labeled with iodine I 123 (I-123) with potential radioimmunolocalization applications. The antibody moiety of iodine I 123 anti-CEA recombinant diabody T84.66 binds to cells expressing CEA, selectively delivering I-123 upon cellular internalization and allowing the scintigraphic imaging of CEA-expressing tumor cells. CEA, a tumor associated antigen, is overexpressed in many cancer types, including gastrointestinal, breast, non-small cell lung, and thyroid cancers. Compared to whole monoclonal antibodies, diabody fragments offer the advantages of rapid tumor targeting, rapid blood clearance, more uniform tumor distribution, and a lower potential for eliciting an immune response.

A monoclonal antibody targeting the ectoenzyme 5'-ecto-nucleotidase (cluster of differentiation 73; CD73; 5'-NT; ecto-5'-nucleotidase; NT5E), with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody BMS-986179 targets and binds to CD73, leading to clustering and internalization of CD73. This prevents CD73-mediated conversion of extracellular adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine and decreases the amount of free adenosine. This prevents adenosine-mediated suppression of lymphocyte activity and increases the activity of CD8-positive effector cells. This also activates macrophages, and reduces the activity of both myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T lymphocytes. By abrogating the inhibitory effect on the immune system and enhancing the cytotoxic T-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells, tumor cell growth is decreased. CD73, a plasma membrane protein belonging to the 5'-nucleotidase (NTase) family, is upregulated on a number of cancer cell types and catalyzes the conversion of extracellular nucleotides, such as AMP, to membrane-permeable nucleosides, such as adenosine; it plays a key role in adenosine-mediated immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment.

A radioactive isotope of cesium with an atomic mass of 139 and potential application in radiotherapy. Cesium Cs 137 is prevalent due to its spontaneous production, which occurs as a result of nuclear fission of other radioactive materials, such as uranium and plutonium. This radionuclide has a relatively long half-life, 30 years, and decays by emitting beta particles. Both Cs 137 and its metastable nuclear isomer, barium-137m, emit gamma radiation of moderate energy and so are used in sterilization procedures in the food industry or in hospital environments.

A mass spectrometric technique that is used for the analysis of large biomolecules. Analyte molecules are embedded in an excess matrix of small organic molecules that show a high resonant absorption at the laser wavelength used. The matrix absorbs the laser energy, thus inducing a soft disintegration of the sample-matrix mixture into free (gas phase) matrix and analyte molecules and molecular ions. In general, only molecular ions of the analyte molecules are produced, and almost no fragmentation occurs.

A standard operating procedure (SOP) that is a collection of activities and the rules that describe when each activity is performed to achieve a specific purpose or objective(s). EXAMPLE(S): Specimen Collection Protocol; Specimen Processing Protocol; Image Acquisition Protocol OTHER NAME(S): NOTE(S): In modeling, often the same term is used to mean different things and a single concept can have more than one name. In the healthcare arena, the term "protocol" is somewhat overloaded and must be qualified to provide semantic context. Therefore during the early years of the BRIDG project, the term "study protocol" was chosen to disambiguate the concept of the detailed plan for a clinical study (the scope of BRIDG at that time) from other kinds of protocols such as are common in life sciences. In BRIDG, the notion of a study protocol is very specific in purpose and includes (but is not limited to) the design, statistical considerations, activities to test a particular hypothesis or answer a particular question that is the basis of the study, characteristics, specifications, objective(s), background, pre-study/study/post-study portions of the plan (including the design, methodology, statistical considerations, organization). For a more complete discussion of the notion of the study protocol see the classes StudyProtocol, StudyProtocolVersion, StudyProtocolDocument, StudyProtocolDocumentVersion, StudyConduct and all their associations. With the addition of life sciences to the scope of the BRIDG model, there came along (with that scope) the need to identify the kind of protocol that represents a more simple or atomic concept, that of a composite activity that serves as a rule that guides how activities should be performed. This concept, represented by the ProcessProtocol class, has a more limited size than the concept of a study protocol does and represents a standardized approach to doing tasks or activities that are not as big as the plan for a whole study. The BRIDG SCC acknowledges that overloaded terms are problematic. The SCC recognizes that many different users within the BRIDG community will have differing opinions on what the meaning of a term is, which term is the best to use for each concept, and how to define them most effectively. Given that the real meat of a concept is in the definition, the BRIDG SCC aims to choose the most unambiguous term to use as the class name, to make the class definition as explicit and clear as possible, to provide sufficient examples and other names to illustrate the range of possible instances that could be represented by the class. So the BRIDG model is maintaining the distinction between a ProcessProtocol and a StudyProtocol because there is a distinction in the domain that we're trying to disambiguate - the concepts, attributes and relationships that describe an SOP-like, atomic, reusable ProcessProtocol are very different than those of a full-blown clinical trial StudyProtocol. Linking the classes because they both contain the same overloaded word would create artificial complexity in the model and not serve the ultimate purpose of interoperability across systems that need to exchange biomedical research data.|A standard operating procedure (SOP) that is a collection of activities and the rules that describe when each activity is performed to achieve specific purpose or objective(s).

An injectable radiopharmaceutical formulation containing human serum albumin (HSA) microspheres labeled with technetium-99m (Tc-99m) with diagnostic imaging activity. Technetium Tc 99m-labeled albumin microspheres contain the gamma-emitting Tc99m, a metastable nuclide of molybdenum-99. Upon injection into the hepatic artery, the radionuclide portion allows for SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) imaging of distribution patterns of the albumin microspheres. This may possibly predict the distribution of other agents with similar particle sizes within the liver and may give a prediction of the tumor response upon administration of such agents.

<h3>What is lupus?</h3> <p>Lupus is an <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/autoimmunediseases.html">autoimmune disease</a>. This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain.</p> <p>There are several kinds of lupus</p> <ul> <li>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe and can affect many parts of the body.</li> <li>Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go away</li> <li>Subacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sun</li> <li>Drug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.</li> <li>Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.</li> </ul> <h3>What causes lupus?</h3> <p>The cause of lupus is unknown.</p> <h3>Who is at risk for lupus?</h3> <p>Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in white women. It's also more common in Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of lupus?</h3> <p>Lupus can have many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones are</p> <ul> <li>Pain or swelling in joints</li> <li>Muscle pain</li> <li><a href="https://medlineplus.gov/fever.html">Fever</a> with no known cause</li> <li>Red <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/rashes.html">rashes</a>, most often on the face (also called the "butterfly rash")</li> <li>Chest pain when taking a deep breath</li> <li>Hair loss</li> <li>Pale or purple fingers or toes</li> <li>Sensitivity to the sun</li> <li>Swelling in legs or around eyes</li> <li>Mouth ulcers</li> <li>Swollen glands</li> <li><a href="https://medlineplus.gov/fatigue.html">Feeling very tired</a></li> </ul> <p>Symptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms, it is called a flare. Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time.</p> <h3>How is lupus diagnosed?</h3> <p>There is no specific test for lupus, and it's often mistaken for other diseases. So it may take months or years for a doctor to diagnose it. Your doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:</p> <ul> <li>Medical history</li> <li>Complete exam</li> <li>Blood tests</li> <li>Skin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope)</li> <li>Kidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope)</li> </ul> <h3>What are the treatments for lupus?</h3> <p>There is no cure for lupus, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.</p> <p>People with lupus often need to see different doctors. You will have a primary care doctor and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in the diseases of joints and muscles). Which other specialists you see depends on how lupus affects your body. For example, if lupus damages your heart or blood vessels, you would see a cardiologist.</p> <p>Your primary care doctor should coordinate care between your different health care providers and treat other problems as they come up. Your doctor will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You and your doctor should review the plan often to be sure it is working. You should report new symptoms to your doctor right away so that your treatment plan can be changed if needed.</p> <p>The goals of the treatment plan are to</p> <ul> <li>Prevent flares</li> <li>Treat flares when they occur</li> <li>Reduce organ damage and other problems</li> </ul> <p>Treatments may include drugs to</p> <ul> <li>Reduce swelling and pain</li> <li>Prevent or reduce flares</li> <li>Help the immune system</li> <li>Reduce or prevent damage to joints</li> <li>Balance the hormones</li> </ul> <p>Besides taking medicines for lupus, you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or infection.</p> <p>Alternative treatments are those that are not part of standard treatment. At this time, no research shows that alternative medicine can treat lupus. Some alternative or complementary approaches may help you cope or reduce some of the stress associated with living with a chronic illness. You should talk to your doctor before trying any alternative treatments.</p> <h3>How can I cope with lupus?</h3> <p>It is important to take an active role in your treatment. It helps to learn more about lupus - being able to spot the warning signs of a flare can help you prevent the flare or make the symptoms less severe.</p> <p>It is also important to find ways to cope with the stress of having lupus. Exercising and finding ways to relax may make it easier for you to cope. A good support system can also help.</p> <p class="">NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</p>|This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake.

A human monoclonal antibody directed against the human epidermal growth factor receptor HER3 (ErbB3) with potential antineoplastic activity. Anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody LJM716 possesses a novel mechanism of action; LJM716 binds to and locks HER3 in the inactive conformation and does not interfere with its interaction with neuregulin (NRG). The inactivated form of HER3 blocks the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting cellular proliferation in HER2 or NRG expressing tumor cells. HER3, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is frequently overexpressed in tumors; it has no active kinase domain but is activated through heterodimerization with other members of the EGFR receptor family, such as HER2.

The sodium salt of a semisynthetic heparin-like glucosaminoglycan. Although its mechanism of action is unknown, pentosan polysulfate may act as a buffer to control cell permeability by preventing irritating solutes from reaching cells coated with it. Administered orally, excreted pentosan polysulfate adheres to the urinary bladder wall, preventing irritants from entering bladder cells and the development or progression of interstitial cystitis (IC), a complication of some chemotherapies. This agent also exhibits anticoagulant and fibrinolytic properties.

Catalysis of the reaction: 8-oxo-7,8-dihydrodeoxyguanosine-triphosphate + H2O = 8-oxo-7,8-dihydrodeoxyguanosine phosphate + diphosphate. 8-oxo-7,8-dihydrodeoxyguanosine-triphosphate, or 8-oxo-dGTP, is the oxidised form of the free guanine nucleotide and can act as a potent mutagenic substrate for DNA synthesis causing transversion mutations. 8-oxo-dGTPase hydrolyses 8-oxo-dGTP to its monophosphate form to prevent the misincorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP into cellular DNA.

A monoclonal antibody directed against human hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR or c-Met), with potential antineoplastic activity. Telisotuzumab binds to c-Met, thereby preventing both c-Met binding to its ligand, HGF and the subsequent activation of the HGF/c-Met signaling pathway. This may cause cell death in c-Met-expressing tumor cells. c-Met, a receptor tyrosine kinase overexpressed or mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in cancer cell growth, survival, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis.|A monoclonal antibody directed against human hepatocyte growth factor receptor, with potential anti-cancer activity.

The CD40 receptor was first associated with expression in B cells and the role it plays through its ligand CD40L (CD154) in moderating T cell activation. Broader expression may indicate a broader role for CD40 and CD40L in immune function and disease states such as transplant rejection and HIV infection. Disruption and modulation of CD40 interaction with CD40L may prove therapeutic in the treatment of autoimmune disorders, heart disease, and cancer. As a member of the TNF receptor family, CD40 relies on interaction with TRAF proteins to mediate an intracellular signal in response to CD40L binding. The pathway downstream of TRAFs activates the transcription factor NF-kappaB through a kinase pathway involving map kinases, NIK (NF-kappaB inducing kinase) and I-kappa B kinases. Some CD40 responses like regulation of immunoglobulin expression might be mediated by NF-kappaB transcriptional activation. (This definition may be outdated - see the DesignNote.)|The TNF receptor was first associated with expression in B cells and the role it plays through its ligand CD40L (CD154) in modulating T cell activation.

An orally available, ATP-competitive inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinases, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and C-ros oncogene 1 (Ros1), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, lorlatinib binds to and inhibits both ALK and ROS1 kinases. The kinase inhibition leads to disruption of ALK- and ROS1-mediated signaling and eventually inhibits tumor cell growth in ALK- and ROS1-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, lorlatinib is able to cross the blood brain barrier. ALK belongs to the insulin receptor superfamily and plays an important role in nervous system development; ALK dysregulation and gene rearrangements are associated with a series of tumors. ROS1, overexpressed in certain cancer cells, plays a key role in cell growth and survival of cancer cells.

A monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1, PCD-1; PDCD1) protein, with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody AGEN2034 binds to PD-1, and thereby blocks its binding to the PD-1 ligand programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), and prevents the activation of its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of cytotoxic T cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on activated T cells, negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligand; it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.
