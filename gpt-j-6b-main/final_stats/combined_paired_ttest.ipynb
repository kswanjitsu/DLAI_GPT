      "a monoclonal antibody targeting the ectoenzyme 5'-ecto-nucleotidase (cluster of differentiation 73; cd73; 5'-nt; ecto-5'-nucleotidase; nt5e), with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. upon administration, anti-cd73 monoclonal antibody bms-986179 targets and binds to cd73, leading to clustering and internalization of cd73. this prevents cd73-mediated conversion of extracellular adenosine monophosphate (amp) to adenosine and decreases the amount of free adenosine. this prevents adenosine-mediated suppression of lymphocyte activity and increases the activity of cd8-positive effector cells. this also activates macrophages, and reduces the activity of both myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mdscs) and regulatory t lymphocytes. by abrogating the inhibitory effect on the immune system and enhancing the cytotoxic t-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells, tumor cell growth is decreased. cd73, a plasma membrane protein belonging to the 5'-nucleotidase (ntase) family, is upregulated on a number of cancer cell types and catalyzes the conversion of extracellular nucleotides, such as amp, to membrane-permeable nucleosides, such as adenosine; it plays a key role in adenosine-mediated immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment. check for \"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/intervention/c132266\" active clinical trials using this agent.
