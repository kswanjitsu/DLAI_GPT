a monoclonal antibody targeting the ectoenzyme 5'-ecto-nucleotidase (cluster of differentiation 73; cd73; 5'-nt; ecto-5'-nucleotidase; nt5e), with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. upon administration, anti-cd73 monoclonal antibody bms-986179 targets and binds to cd73, leading to clustering and internalization of cd73. this prevents cd73-mediated conversion of extracellular adenosine monophosphate (amp) to adenosine and decreases the amount of free adenosine. this prevents adenosine-mediated suppression of lymphocyte activity and increases the activity of cd8-positive effector cells. this also activates macrophages, and reduces the activity of both myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mdscs) and regulatory t lymphocytes. by abrogating the inhibitory effect on the immune system and enhancing the cytotoxic t-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells, tumor cell growth is decreased. cd73, a plasma membrane protein belonging to the 5'-nucleotidase (ntase) family, is upregulated on a number of cancer cell types and catalyzes the conversion of extracellular nucleotides, such as amp, to membrane-permeable nucleosides, such as adenosine; it plays a key role in adenosine-mediated immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment. check for "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/intervention/c132266" active clinical trials using this agent.

a standard operating procedure (sop) that is a collection of activities and the rules that describe when each activity is performed to achieve a specific purpose or objective(s). example(s): specimen collection protocol; specimen processing protocol; image acquisition protocol other name(s): note(s): in modeling, often the same term is used to mean different things and a single concept can have more than one name. in the healthcare arena, the term "protocol" is somewhat overloaded and must be qualified to provide semantic context. therefore during the early years of the bridg project, the term "study protocol" was chosen to disambiguate the concept of the detailed plan for a clinical study (the scope of bridg at that time) from other kinds of protocols such as are common in life sciences. in bridg, the notion of a study protocol is very specific in purpose and includes (but is not limited to) the design, statistical considerations, activities to test a particular hypothesis or answer a particular question that is the basis of the study, characteristics, specifications, objective(s), background, pre-study/study/post-study portions of the plan (including the design, methodology, statistical considerations, organization). for a more complete discussion of the notion of the study protocol see the classes studyprotocol, studyprotocolversion, studyprotocoldocument, studyprotocoldocumentversion, studyconduct and all their associations. with the addition of life sciences to the scope of the bridg model, there came along (with that scope) the need to identify the kind of protocol that represents a more simple or atomic concept, that of a composite activity that serves as a rule that guides how activities should be performed. this concept, represented by the processprotocol class, has a more limited size than the concept of a study protocol does and represents a standardized approach to doing tasks or activities that are not as big as the plan for a whole study. the bridg scc acknowledges that overloaded terms are problematic. the scc recognizes that many different users within the bridg community will have differing opinions on what the meaning of a term is, which term is the best to use for each concept, and how to define them most effectively. given that the real meat of a concept is in the definition, the bridg scc aims to choose the most unambiguous term to use as the class name, to make the class definition as explicit and clear as possible, to provide sufficient examples and other names to illustrate the range of possible instances that could be represented by the class. so the bridg model is maintaining the distinction between a processprotocol and a studyprotocol because there is a distinction in the domain that we're trying to disambiguate - the concepts, attributes and relationships that describe an sop-like, atomic, reusable processprotocol are very different than those of a full-blown clinical trial studyprotocol. linking the classes because they both contain the same overloaded word would create artificial complexity in the model and not serve the ultimate purpose of interoperability across systems that need to exchange biomedical research data.|A standard treat software (sop) that is a grouping of trait and the rules that mark when each trait is re-create to achieve a fact goal or lens (s).  Example (s): sample grouping rule; sample walk rule; image acquiring rule other name (s): note (s): in re-create, often the same term is used to mean different things and a single concept can have more than one name.  In the care playing_field, the term `` rule '' is somewhat loaded and must be added to provide semantic context.  Therefore, during the early years of the bridge project, the term `` study rule '' was chosen to clarify the concept of the detailed plan for a clinical study (the scope of the bridge at that time) from other kinds of rule such as are common in the life sciences.  in bridg , the notion of a study rule is very fact in goal and includes ( but is not limited to ) the design , statistical kindness , trait to test a part opinion or answer a part question that is the part of the study , property , restriction , lens ( s ) , stress , pre-study/study/post-study gift of the plan ( including the sketch , method , statistical kindness , organization ) .  For a more complete speech of the notion of the study rule see the class study protocol, studyprotocolversion, studyprotocoldocument, studyprotocoldocumentversion, study conduct and all their groups.  With the addition of life sciences to the scope of the bridge model, there came along (with that scope) the need to recognize the kind of rule that permute a more simple or atomic concept, that of a flower activity that serves as a rule that guides how trait should be re-create.  This concept, permute by the process protocol class, has a more limited size than the concept of a study rule does and permute a measure come to doing tasks or trait that are not as big as the plan for a whole study.  The bridge scc accept that load terms are problematic.  The such prize that many different users within the bridge community will have differing judgment on what the meaning of a term is, which term is better to use for each concept, and how to choose them most effectively.  given that the real meat of a concept is in the distinctness , the bridg scc aims to choose the most unambiguous term to use as the class name , to make the class distinctness as explicit and clear as possible , to provide sufficient examples and other names to picture the range of possible instances that could be permute by the class .  so the bridg model is confirm the distinction between a processprotocol and a studyprotocol because there is a distinction in the domain that we 're trying to clarify - the concepts , abstraction and relation that mark an sop-like , atomic , reusable processprotocol are very different than those of a full-blown clinical trial studyprotocol .  Think the classes because they both contain the same load word would create artificial quality of the model and not serve the ultimate goal of ability across systems that need to change biomedical research data.|18.687831325301232|49.59672727272729|19.489684452094092|16.101246753246752|10.98639392873528|9.532777363465161|23.676305220883535|18.733018181818178|22.59917571494112|13.008954802259886|117.96905039034601|104.78313103739549|30.212507171543315|27.132467532467537
